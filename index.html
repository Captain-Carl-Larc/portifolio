                <p>
                    I am a junior developer, currently enrolled in PLP academy, planning to major in AI for software engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have basic skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React Js, Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. 
                </p>
